## ⚡️ Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- No installation required for demo

### 🚀 Local Usage

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step needed.

## ⚠️ Important: How to Run This Project

> **Note:** You cannot simply double-click `index.html` to run this app because browser security restrictions will prevent the audio samples from loading locally. You must serve the project with a local or remote web server.

### 🖥️ Recommended Ways to Run

#### 1. VS Code (Recommended)
- Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
- Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
- The app will open in your browser and all features will work correctly.

#### 2. JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, PhpStorm, etc.)
- Right-click `index.html` and choose **"Open in Browser"** (JetBrains IDEs automatically serve files over HTTP).
- Alternatively, use the built-in web server feature.

#### 3. Command Line (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Python 3** (cross-platform):
  ```sh
  python -m http.server 8000
  # Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
  ```
- **Node.js (http-server)**:
  ```sh
  npx http-server .
  # Then open the shown URL (usually http://localhost:8080)
  ```
- **PHP (if installed):**
  ```sh
  php -S localhost:8000
  # Then open http://localhost:8000
  ```

> Do not use the `file://` protocol (double-clicking the file) — audio samples will not load!
